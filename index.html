						<p>My interest in IT had sparked at roughly the age of 5. At that time in my life, I spent time in Tokyo, Japan whilst my parents worked. 
							During the time of living in Tokyo, there was an obvious language language barrier so a great way of bonding with other children my age was through video games. 
							At the time, there was the release of the first Sony PlayStation. Other gaming consoles from Nintendo and Sega were quite common and had been established in the industry. 
							Video games and consoles aside, Tokyo at the time really embraced technology. I have few memories from that time in my life, but I do remember robotics in the house starting to emerge into the market. 
							Moving into today’s world, I’d consider technology to be an imperative part of my life. 
							In my life, it encompasses various forms of social media and other communication applications through my phone, completing work remotely from personal and work equipment at home to using collaboration tools online for university and work.

				<p> At the point of leaving High School, I did have a passion for Architecture. I decided to go that route for the foreseeable future. 
					Moving forward in my professional career, I don’t see there to be a continual passion for Architecture or Engineering. 
					After doing some light browsing to further my studies, I came across Open Universities Australia and looked into completing an IT degree. 
					From the available degree’s to complete online, RMIT provides a wide range of subjects and specific topics of interest along the way. A
					nother major factor in deciding to go the online route was flexibility. 
					With working full time, studying online allows me to study at my own pace and to comfortably set my own schedule on how many subjects I take on at once.

		<h1> Myers Briggs Type Indicator </h1>
		<p><img src="myers-briggs test.PNG" alt="MBTI Results"><p>
		<h3> ISTJ - The Inspector </h3>
		<p> ISTJ'S are responsible organisers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. they are neat and orderly, inside and out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do. </p>
		<h3> ISTP - The Craftsperson </h3>
		<p> ISTP'S are observant artisans with an understanding of mechanics and an interest in troubleshooting. They approach their environments with a flexible logic, looking for practical solutions to the problems at hand. </p>
		<h3> What do the results of this test mean for me? </h3>
		<p> I believe that the results from the Myers-Briggs are quite accurate. After reading the results with self-reflection, it allows me to understand my strengths and weaknesses as well as potential personality clashes when working in a group. </p>
		<h3> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
		<p> The results wouldn’t necessarily influence my behaviour in a team. In a group setting, communication is a major part of having a successful team. Based off the results, as well as being self-aware of my actions, I tend to be very direct and straightforward. I tend to focus on details and communication is primarily used to push tasks along. </p>
		<h3> How should I take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
		<p> When forming a team, I would primarily focus on partnering people who are great communicators with a clear path and are very detail oriented. </p>
		<h3> What do these results mean for me? </h3>
		<p> Based off the results, it identifies that I prefer learning best by applying what I learn directly into real world scenarios. Applying the results to previous and current life experiences, I completely agree and find the results extremely accurate. I find that for me to effectively learn, I need to understand how a concept applies the real world and consistently practice the concepts. </p>

		<h3> What is David Kolb's Learning Styles and Experimental Learning Cycle?</h3>
		<p> David Kolb is an American Educational Theorist who developed a quiz to develop and identify my personal preference in learning. </p>
		<h3> Pragmatist Style </h3>
		<p> Pragmatist need to be able to see how you put the learning into practice in the real world. Abstract concepts and games are of the limited use unless they can see a way to put the ideas into action. Pragmatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work. </p>
		<h3> Activits Style </h3>
		<p> Activists like to immerse themselves fully in new experiences. They enjoy the ‘here and now’, and tend to be open minded, enthusiastic and flexible. They have a tendency to act first and consider the consequences later, and they often see to center activities around themselves. </p>
		<h3> Reflector Style </h3>
		<p> Reflectors prefer to stand back and observe. They tend to be cautious, preferring to take a back seat. They like to collect and analyse information to help them reach their conclusions, which they may take considerable time and effort to develop. Reflectors see the big picture by using information gathered from previous experience as well as the here and now. </p>
		<h3> Theorist Style </h3>
		<p> Theorists like to think through problems in a logical manner. They value rationality and objectivity, and like to assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories. They are disciplined, aiming to fit things into a rational order. </p>

		<h1> Interactive Leadership Style Assessment by University of Southern California </h1>

		<p><img src="Leadership Test 2.PNG" alt="Executive Master of Leadership"></p>

		<h3> What do these test results mean for myself?</h3>
		<p> As a third test, I took the Interactive Leadership Style Assessment made by the University of Southern California. I believe this test helps myself become more aware of my personal traits and possible clashes that could arise when forming a group. The result I achieved was “Transformative Leader”. According to the test, Transformation Leaders foster curiosity in their teams and work as agents of change. They work together to improve conditions and achieve goals. Inspiration and cooperation drive transformational leaders towards positive change. </p>

		<h3> How do I think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
		<p> I believe the results may have varying influence on my behaviour in a team. Personally, I believe I adapt according to the personalities that are in a group, with the exception that if there is an authoritarian figure in the group. I tend to adapt really well into groups especially if there are clearly defined roles and responsibilities within the group.  </p>

		<h3> How should I take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
		<p> First and foremost, I do think it is important to be self-aware and aware of other individuals’ personality traits when it comes to forming a team. The ideal situation would be maximise cohesion within the team and minimize personality conflicts in order to achieve the desired end result. Using the results from this test, it would be imperative  to take into account other’s leadership styles and identify characteristic that I lack that another individual may have a strong attributes in. </p>
