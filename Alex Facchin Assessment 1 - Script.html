						<p>My interest in IT gradually grew on me from when I was around 5 years old. When I was 5 years old I spent time in Tokyo, Japan whilst my parents had jobs.
							At the time of living in Japan (1995), there was the obvious language barrier, so a great way of bonding with other children was through video games.
							At the time, there was the release of the first Sony PlayStation, also gaming consoles from Nintendo and Sega had already been established in the industry.
							Video games and consoles aside, Tokyo at the time had really embraced technology. Moving into today’s world, I’d consider technology to be an imperative part of my life.
							It encompasses everything from communicating with friends and family through my phone, completing work remotely from my personal equipment at home to using online collaboration tools online for work as well.</p>

				<p> At the point of leaving High School, the decision to do further my education came down to either studying Architecture. I decided to go the route of Architecture at the time.
					At this point in life, I felt ready to continue my studies and complete more study in IT.
					At the time of looking to continue studying, my priorities were flexibility, ability to complete the course online and also reputation of the University.
					From doing some research and hearing information through advertisements, Open Universities Australia was the best option for providing me with the flexibility I need and also providing the course to be completed online.
					Out of all the universities that offered a Bachelor’s of IT online, RMIT had the best reputation, and other universities required me to complete some of the course on campus. </p>

		<p><img src="Learning Style test 2.PNG" alt="Matching Learning Types"/><p>
		<h3> Pragmatist Style </h3>
		<p> Pragmatists need to be able to see how to put the learning into practice in the real world. Abstract concepts and games are of the limited use unless they can see a way to put the ideas into action. Pramatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work. </p>

		<h3> Reflector Style </h3>
		<p> Reflectors prefer to stand back and observe. They tend to be cautious, preferring to take a back seat. They like to collect and analyse information to help them reach their conclusions, which they may take considerable time and effort to develop. Reflectors see the big picture by using information gathered from previous experience as well as the here and now. </p>
		<h3> Theorist Style </h3>
		<p> Theorists like to think through problems in a logical manner. They value rationality and objectivity, and like to assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories. They are disciplined, aiming to fit things into a rational oder. </p>

		<h2> Interactive Leadership Style Assessment by University of Southern California </h2>

		<p><img src="Leadership test 1.PNG" alt="Transformational Leader"></p>
		<p><img src="Leadership Test 2.PNG" alt="Executive Master of Leadership"></p>

		<h3> What do these test results mean for myself?</h3>
		<p> As a third test, I took the Interactive Leadership Style Assessment made by the University of Southern California. I believe this test helps myself become self-aware of my personal traits and possible clashes that could arise when forming a group. The result I achieved was ‘Transformative Leader’. According to the test, Transformational Leaders foster curiosity in their teams and work as agents of change. They work together to improve conditions and achieve goals. Inspiration and cooperation drive transformational leaders towards positive change. </p>

		<h3> How do I think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
		<p> I believe the results may have varying influence on my behaviour in a team. Personally, I believe I adapt according to the personalities that are in the group, except for if there is an authoritarian figure in the group. I tend to adapt really well into groups especially if there are clearly defined roles within the group. </p>

		<h3> How should I take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
		<p> First and foremost I do think it is important to be self-aware and aware of other individuals personality traits when it comes to forming a team. The ideal situation would be maximise cohesion within the team and minimise personality conflicts in order to achieve the desired end result. Using the results from this test, it would be imperative to take into account other’s leadership styles and identify characteristics that I lack that another individual may have a strong attributes in.   </p>
